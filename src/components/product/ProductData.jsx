    description: "The most obvious design feature of the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra is the humongous camera bump on the back of the phone. Placed next to the triple camera system (more on this later) there’s a 1.1-inch 126 x 294 color AMOLED display. It has an always-on feature, it can display notifications, and it also acts like a mirror when you take a selfie using the main camera system. It’s a really interesting solution and we’re itching to try it out in a real-life scenario. The tiny display is also quite bright with a peak brightness of 450 nits. Speaking of displays, the Mi 11 Ultra comes equipped with a top-of-the-line 120Hz 6.81-inch main AMOLED panel. It’s a curved display with a resolution of 3200 x 1440 pixels and a 20:9 aspect ratio. Xiaomi cites 900 nits typical brightness and up to 1,700 nits peak brightness, and there’s also HDR10+ and Dolby Vision baked into the panel. Fast refresh-rate displays are now becoming a standard, and the Mi 11 Ultra delivers on this front as well. It features a 120Hz refresh rate display and thanks to the AdaptiveSync technology, the panel can switch between 30/60/90 and 120Hz depending on the situation. This is accompanied by a 480Hz touch sampling rate - one of the highest in any smartphone to date.",

    description: "the OnePlus 9 Pro is easily one of the best-specced Android phones announced so far in 2021.
